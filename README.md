# Flash

Flash words/sentences for training sight reading. Before each flash a dancing animation is shown, adding simple physical excercises to ease learning.

Thanks to Kofi Gumbs (https://github.com/hkgumbs) for getting me started with his dancing pill figures (and handy Makefile)!
A big part of this code is copied from https://github.com/hkgumbs/rc/blob/master/src/Visualizer.elm 


Also thanks to Dudu Capoeira for his great groovy percussion tracks, like the Samba Reggae at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyItYAx0guA
